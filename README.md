## 🧬 Context

As a future student at **EPF School of Engineering**, I received a **temporary access QR Code** for the campus buildings while waiting for my ISIC card.  
The issue is that this QR Code was sent by **email**, making it inconvenient to find and use on a daily basis (you always have to search the email or rely on a screenshot).

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and modern solution that allows you to:
- generate and store this QR Code directly on your smartphone,
- add it to **Apple Wallet** or **Google Wallet**,
- and display it automatically when near the EPF campus.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Standard-compliant QR Code**  
  Generates QR Codes that follow standards to ensure maximum compatibility with access control systems.

- ✅ **Apple Wallet support**  
  Creates dematerialized passes directly integrable into **Apple Wallet** (iPhone & Apple Watch).

- ✅ **QR Code import**  
  Ability to import an existing QR Code (e.g., from a screenshot) and use it in the application.

- ✅ **Automatic display near campus**  
  The pass is automatically shown on the smartphone when the user is close to the EPF campus.

  Ability to generate a pass for visitors.
